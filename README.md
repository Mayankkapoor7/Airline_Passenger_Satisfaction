# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction

This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger data to predict customer satisfaction using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information such as demographics, travel type, flight class, delays, and in-flight services (e.g., Wi-Fi, entertainment, food, seat comfort).

Key Highlights:

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and understand key factors influencing satisfaction.

Applied and compared multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify passenger satisfaction.

Identified important features contributing to satisfaction, including in-flight entertainment, food and drink quality, and legroom service.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to select the best-performing one.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:
Developed a predictive model that helps airlines understand customer priorities and enhance service quality based on data-driven insights.
